; What is a trivially solvable problem?
; Bundling the empty list

; How are trivial problems solved?
; By returning empty list

; How does the algorithm generate new problems that are more easily solvable than the original one?
; Is there one new problem that we generate or are there several?
; We generate one new problem - by bundling the list that is the given list without first N elements.

; Is the solution of the given problem the same as the solution of (one of) the new problems?
; Yes

; We need one instance of generate-problem
